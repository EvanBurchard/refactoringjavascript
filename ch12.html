<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The techniques we covered ranged from things as small as renaming variables, to as large as applying paradigms like FP and OOP. Between paradigms, architectures, libraries, frameworks, and even individual style your "JavaScript" might be wildly different than someone else's. You might even find yourself in two very different modes from one project to another. If you write a simple 3 line shell script in JavaScript, you might not even want tests or write any functions. You might completely leave off scoping declarations, even a simple <code>var</code>. You might be working with a team that thinks well in OOP. In that case, ES2015 classes and applying appropriate design patterns might be the way to go. For more functional (or just function-curious) teams, FP is a great approach. It doesn't have to be all-or-nothing, and it doesn't have to be scary. Turn your linter off every once in a while.</p>

<p>Whether you're making decisions about small stylistic changes or large architectural changes, ideally this book has provided you with a good basis for making choices. The alternatives of simply using a framework, rewriting into another framework, or putting up with JavaScript Jenga are comparatively expensive and demoralizing.</p>

<p>"JavaScript" is basically a mythological animal. "Your JavaScript" starts with whatever styles, tools, platforms, paradigms, ideologies, and purposes you decide to pursue. Having a well developed "your JavaScript" opens up a tremendous amount of possibilities.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this book has helped you craft "your JavaScript," leading to creating more maintainable, confidence-inspiring code bases.</p>
