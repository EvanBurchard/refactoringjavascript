The code and text for the book, Refactoring JavaScript


This repo is a mirror of the text, rather than a living document. If for no other reason, this is because the book, via the publisher, is the "upstream branch" of this. 

There is a way to submit errata to O'Reilly here: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053262.do

If you feel like submitting an issue, although I'm happy that you're engaging with the text and appreciate your ideas, I'm unlikely to accept any PRs.

But if there's anything in the text that gets in the way of your understanding, you can contact me through refactoringjs.com for questions. I always respond.
