<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>Welcome to <em>Refactoring JavaScript</em>. Throughout this book, we'll be looking at ways to write better JavaScript, drawing inspiration from classical refactoring techniques while exploring various styles of coding.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" id="why-this-book-exists-3mfwCA">
<h1>Why This Book Exists</h1>

<p>Like it or not, JavaScript is not going away. No matter what framework or "compiles-to-js" language or library you use, bugs and performance concerns will always be an issue if the underlying quality of your JavaScript is poor. Rewrites, including porting to the framework of the month are terribly expensive and unpredictable. The bugs won’t magically go away, and can happily reproduce themselves in a new context. To complicate things further, features will get dropped, at least temporarily.</p>

<p>This book provides clear guidance on how best to avoid these pathological approaches to writing JavaScript. Bad code doesn’t have to stay that way. And making it better doesn’t have to be intimidating or unreasonably expensive.&nbsp;</p>

<section data-type="sect1" id="who-this-book-is-for-jPf0Fr">
<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>

<p>This book is meant for programmers who have some experience writing bad code, and an interest in writing better code. It's for those writing JavaScript on the front-end or the back-end. It's for those writing JavaScript by choice as well as those who are "stuck with it" due to JavaScript's monopoly of the browser platform.</p>

<p>If you're an absolute beginner, you might want to write some bad code for a couple months first. If you're not interested in writing better code, you might not have the patience for this book. If neither of those situations describes you, we're good to go.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, there are numerous efforts working to make JavaScript better, while at the same time others aim to make it obsolete. The number of ways to write good and bad JavaScript continues to expand. Frameworks can go a long way toward handling complexity, but programmers constrained by frameworks will be limited. If you find that you (or your codebase) are struggling to work outside of a framework (or at some of the more confusing edges of it), this book should give you new ideas in how to approach your work.</p>

<p>If you have trouble testing, debugging, or having confidence in your codebase, this book should be helpful.</p>

<p>Most of us don't work on perfect codebases, especially in JavaScript, where engineers might primarily use Ruby, Python, Java, etc. What this book does is help you identify what specific parts of a codebase are bad, while providing a multitude of options for improvement.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" id="how-to-use-this-book-2vfWUR">
<h1>How To Use This Book</h1>

<p>Chapters 1-5 describe the interplay between JavaScript, refactoring, quality, confidence and testing. In many books, it is common to tack on testing to the end. In this book, for the types of code we are exploring, this wouldn't be appropriate. Testing is essential for confidence. Confidence is essential to refactoring. Refactoring is essential to quality, which is the goal.</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
testing -&gt; confidence -&gt; refactoring -&gt; quality
</pre>

<p>JavaScript (and its ecosystem) happens to provide the space in which that transformation takes place, so those chapters necessarily include an exploration of the language itself. If you're completely comfortable with the transformation described above, it's possible that you might want to skim or skip these chapters. Although that is not recommended, it is your book, so you can use it however you want. If it's best use is as a doorstop or to start a fire for warmth or as a sacrifice of some sort, go for it. It's your book. If you find an unconventional use for the book, email me a picture or video. I'm at http://evanburchard.com/contact or @evanburchard on Twitter and GitHub.</p>

</div>

<p>After Chapter 5, things get harder, especially if you skipped 1-5. There's more code to write and follow along with. In Chapters 6 and 7, we go through refactoring functions and objects, and we don't shy away from some of the more complicated bits of JavaScript. Generally, the goal of these chapters is to provide options for improving code without radically changing the interface. Through applying techniques found in these two chapters, you'll be able to turn a mess of a codebase into one that has a decent baseline of quality.</p>

<p>Chapters 8, 9 and 10 are dedicated to specific topics (Design Patterns, Asynchronous Programming, and Functional Programming) that can take your code beyond that baseline, but necessarily involve more aggressive changes. With the design patterns in Chapter 8, we recognize ways to extend and draw from JavaScript's object-oriented side, as well a historical connection between refactoring and OOP. With Chapter 9, we deal with the reality that many JavaScript codebases have more than one thing to do at once. In Chapter 10, we take a tour of functional programming through a couple of libraries that provide useful interfaces which go beyond those that our standard Array functions (<code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, etc.) give us.</p>

<p>In some sense, those chapters break away from our initial goal to refactor by changing the <em>implementation details</em> without changing the <em>interface</em>. On the other hand, these interfaces are both useful and sometimes unavoidable. We could easily find wanting to write that is necessarily asynchronous for performance reasons. Or we could find ourselves "stuck" in a codebase that has much invested in <em>good or bad</em> attempts at OOP or FP. So either through our choice or by what we inherit, these are parts of JavaScript that we should pay attention to and be able to improve upon. If you adopt a completely different paradigm to a codebase, it is unlikely that you'll be "refactoring" in the sense that we mean throughout most of the book.</p>

<p>If we want to be rigid about it, these chapters still refactor <em>within</em> their paradigms (OOP to better OOP, async to better async, and FP to better FP), and if we wish to think in the broadest terms about the execution of our program (e.g. "running <strong><code>node <em>myprogram.js</em></code></strong>" as <em>input</em> and "being satisfied with how it ran" as <em>output</em>) then we can be refactoring even while jumping from paradigm to paradigm. I encourage you to first work with a narrower sense of smaller, incremental changes that are easy to test and be confident in.</p>

<p>To quote William Opdyke's original thesis on refactoring:</p>

<blockquote>
<div data-canvas-width="750.2574999999997">This definition of semantic equivalence allows changes throughout the program, as long as this mapping of input to output values remains the same. Imagine that a <span class="highlight selected">circle</span> is drawn around the parts of a program affected by a refactoring. The behavior as viewed from outside the circle does not change. For some refactorings, the circle surrounds most or all of the program. For example, if a variable is referenced throughout a program, the refactoring that changes its name will affect much of the program. For other refactorings, the circle covers a much smaller area;</div>

<div data-canvas-width="141.12724999999998">for example, only part of one function body is effected when a particular function call contained in it is inline expanded. In both cases, the key idea is that the results (including side effects) of operations invoked and references made from outside the circle do not change, as viewed from outside the circle.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Although we're free to draw "the circle" as large as we'd like, it's very common for the term "refactoring" to get thrown around to simply mean "changing code." As we discuss in Chapter 1, it is not. That is easier to see on a small scale, like the ones that we spend the most pages on. Think of Chapters 8, 9, and 10 first as architectural options, and second as possibilities for creating better code (safely and incrementally) within those options. As an example, if someone says something about "<em>Refactoring</em> to use asynchronous code" it is likely too broad of a problem to execute in a safe and incremental way. But if you want to think of Chapter 9 as giving you the power to do so, I can't stop you. It's your book now. You can draw "the circle" as large as you want.</p>

<h1>Some Words in This Book</h1>

<section data-type="sect2" id="app-application-program-W5fvTocw">
<h2>App, application, program</h2>

<p>Some words in this book are imprecise. "App," "application," "program," and "website" are interchangeable much of the time. In case there is any confusion, this book describes general principles for improving the quality of JavaScript, so none of those terms should be taken too literally. Maybe your code is a library or framework? In any case, the techniques in this book should apply just fine.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2" id="inclusivity-through-words-and-diagrams-y5f4CNcZ">
<h2>Inclusivity Through Words and Diagrams</h2>

<p>Some words in this book may not feel inclusive to everyone. I tried to balance the use of "he" and "she," which I realize isn't everyone's preference. Some people might advocate for "they" or other less common singular 3rd person pronouns. Others might go for always using "she." If you are feeling up for it and have any thoughts on how I might improve on this aspect in the future, please <a href="http://evanburchard.com/contact">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am realizing (too late) that my reliance on diagrams, especially those in Chapter 5, may do a terrible disservice to readers with a visual impairment. If you feel like you've missed out on any content for this reason, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions <a href="http://evanburchard.com/contact">here</a>.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2" id="users-g2fEhKcL">
<h2>Users</h2>

<p>There's also one word in this book I really hate, and that's "users." It's imprecise and also creates some distance between the creators (developers/designers) and consumers (users). More precise and charitable words are often specific to the problem domain, or else we're stuck with terms like "people" or "people who use the program/website." If there is no more specific term than "person" or "user," (even including "customer") it might be a hint that the business model is purely based on selling people as data, but that's another discussion.</p>

<p>The point is that that term is used in this book to convey a familiar concept: a person who uses the program/website. Also, there are not yet magnanimous and accurate terms to supplant the related terms of "user experience (UX) or "user interface" (UI). Rather than explaining this in several places or using nonstandard or specific terms for frequently abstract concepts, I chose to save the effort and just talk about it here.</p>

<p>In any case, I fully endorse the following quote (and its implications) by "The Leonardo da Vinci of Data," Edward Tufte:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are only two industries that refer to their customers as users: illegal drugs, and software houses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a movement called "ethical design" which hopefully helps the industry shed this term (and the inconsiderate practices that stem from it) at some point.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2" id="api-interface-implementation-client-code-OzfoFOcV">
<h2>API, interface, implementation, "client code"</h2>

<p>This gets a little murky, but one thing I wish I could highlight more is the hierarchy (not in terms of objects), but in the interface of a well-designed codebase. When a code is a simple script, we expect it to run top to bottom, as a procedure. As a codebase matures (through design, not butchery mixed with entropy), we expect it to develop in 3 main layers (although this is obviously extended in more complex codebases).</p>

<p>The first, is the code behind the scenes, deeper in the codebase, is referred to in this book as the "implementation." For refactoring, the most important distinction is between the implementation and the outer layer. This second layer can be called the "interface" or "API" and describes the "public" functions and objects that one should expect to interact with if a code base was used as a module. The third layer of consequence is sometimes called the "client code" or "calling code." It refers to the code that is written to interact with the "interface" layer. This is the code that people using a module would write, as well as the testing code that we will write to test the interface layer.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="basics-of-architecture-NVuOhAFbcr"><h6>Note</h6>
<h1>Basics of Architecture</h1>

<p>Throughout this book, we're creating programs that start as very unstructured, and our main thrust (regardless of a paradigm like Object-Oriented Programming or Functional Programming) is to make divisions between these three layers. This is what allows code to be testable and portable. If you're mostly reliant on frameworks that provide their own organization, this process might be unfamiliar.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2" id="inputs-non-local-and-free-variables-ogfXH8cL">
<h2>Inputs (non-local and "free variables")</h2>

<p>Throughout the book (especially in Chapter 5), we distinguish between three types of inputs:</p>

<ul>
	<li>explicit inputs (the parameters passed into a function)</li>
	<li>implicit inputs (the <code>this</code> that refers to the containing context object, function, or class)</li>
	<li>non-local inputs (the values used within a function or object that are defined elsewhere)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two things of note here. First, local variables (or constants) created within the scope of a function are not considered "inputs" for the sake of diagramming or otherwise. Second, although the term "non-local input" is used as a precise term in this text, "free variable" is a more common name. However, it is a bit imprecise given that non-local inputs may constants rather than variables. Similarly, some use the term "bound variable" to refer to what we call "explicit inputs," and to some degree, "implicit inputs" as well.&nbsp;</p>
